                    <h4>I like to work, and I'm ready to start my career</h4>
                        <p>I was a cook, then a high-school English teacher, then a cook again. I've been looking for a career that rewards hard work, fulfills my craving to build beautiful things, and utilizes my aptitude for problem solving. I've found it in web development. Just graduated LaunchCode 101 in May 2017, I'm now seeking an apprenticeship. Anywhere in St. Louis or nearby; <strong class="text-danger">back-end</strong>, <strong class="text-danger">front-end</strong>, or <strong class="text-danger">full-stack</strong>; <strong class="text-danger">any language</strong> (I'm comfortable in Python, C#, and JavaScript, but happy to learn more languages); <strong class="text-danger">any operating system</strong> (I have a Mac and a PC, and this site is hosted on a Debian 8 Linode); <strong class="text-danger">any size of company</strong>. I'm not picky about place or pay or project, I just want to start working.</p>

                    <h4>I work hard, love to learn, and I have a high capacity for both</h4>
                        <p>From 19 to 24, I earned a Bachelor's and Master's Degree in English and a Master's Degree in Education from <strong class="text-danger">Truman State University</strong>. I worked as a cook as an undergrad, taught college freshmen part-time as an English graduate student, and taught 7-12th grade full-time as an Education graduate student. I've taught on two continents, and I've cooked in three cities. <strong class="text-danger">Each job I have had, I've been begged to stay</strong>.</p>

                    <h4>I make simple things fast...</h4>
                        <p>This page is a reflection of that. I've coded it from scratch, running on a <strong class="text-danger">Linode</strong>. It uses <strong class="text-danger">Bootstrap</strong>, and that's it right now. I'm going to focus my time on building more projects, making them as organized and simple as possible, and then I'll work on the design.</p>

                    <h4>...and then I make them beautiful</h4>
                        <p>In writing courses, I was constantly told <strong class="text-danger">"Show, don't tell"</strong>. As a cook plating dishes, I focused on the <strong class="text-danger">whitespace</strong> of the plate. In listening to 99% Invisible, I've learned about Norman doors and <strong class="text-danger">feature creep</strong>. None of this is as beautiful as I want it to be, but I hope my projects above, GitHub profile below, and my work in general speaks to these principles of design.</p>

                    <h4>I problem solve</h4>
                        <p>As a student, I learned <strong class="text-danger">how to learn</strong>. As a cook, I learned how to <strong class="text-danger">constantly work</strong>. But as a teacher, I learned to problem solve. Tangibly and intangibly structuring the environment, thinking on my feet, presenting nuanced and complex ideas simply, and focusing on the core of the content. More than that, though, I used problem solving the most with changing my career path. I knew teaching and cooking weren't what I wanted to do with my life, so I saved up money, looked at other careers, decided on computer programming, quit my job, and I've <strong class="text-danger">studied programming full time with LaunchCode and on my own since September 2016</strong>.</p>

                        <p>Each place I've worked, I've had someone from whom to constantly learn. Someone to recommend me books, conferences, podcasts, and other resources. I'm <strong class="text-danger">not</strong> looking for someone to <strong class="text-danger">hold my hand</strong>: I'll work with my peers to get the project done with minimal help from superiors. But this will be my life's work: I want to get as far as I can, and I'd love the guidance of someone who's further ahead on that path.</p>
